# MiP_ProtoPack
A prototyping daughterboard to @adamgreen's [MiP_ProMini-Pack](https://github.com/adamgreen/MiP_ProMini-Pack).  This board allows additional sensors and capability to be added to the MiP_ProMiniPack.

# Notes
This board pulls up JP1 from the MiP_Pro-Mini-Pack in order to keep jumper pins connected to JP1 from getting bent if the MiP falls over backwards.  It also enables a switch to be connected elsewhere on the MiP_ProtoPack.

The FTDI connector is not meant to be pulled up by this MiP_ProtoPack. Instead, I recommended right-angle jumper pins be used to connect the FTDI.

# Installation
Installation is easy!  Just solder female pin headers to the ProMini-Pack pin pads and male pin headers to the ProtoPack and connect the two.  Soldering pin headers for the 6V, 5V and 3.3V pin pads is optional.
